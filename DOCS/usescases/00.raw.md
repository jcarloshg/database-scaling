# Use case: Global User Bases (B2C Platforms)

When you have hundreds of millions of users, a single database cannot store all user profiles, settings, and authentication data.

- **The Strategy:** The current geographic place of the user.
- **Use Case:** Social media platforms (Facebook, X/Twitter).
- **Benefit:** A user in Europe is stored on an EU shard, while a user in Asia is on an APAC shard. This also helps with data residency laws (GDPR).

### Strategy to use:

#### **C. Geographic Sharding**

```
Shard US-East:  Users in USA East Coast
Shard US-West:  Users in USA West Coast
Shard EU:       Users in Europe
Shard Asia:     Users in Asia
```
