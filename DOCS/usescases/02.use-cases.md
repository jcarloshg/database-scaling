# Use cases

Based on the **Geographic Sharding** strategy and the product description, here are the main use cases. These scenarios represent the specific problems this product architecture solves better than any other solution.

### 1. Regulatory Compliance & Data Sovereignty (The "Legal" Use Case)

This is the primary driver for adopting this architecture in the modern web.

- **The Scenario:** A global social platform (e.g., a LinkedIn or TikTok competitor) wants to expand into the European Union, Brazil, and India.
- **The Problem:** The EU has **GDPR**, Brazil has **LGPD**, and India has strictly proposed data localization laws. These laws often forbid or strictly regulate moving personal citizen data outside their physical borders.
- **How the Product Solves It:**
- A user registers from Berlin -> The system detects the IP/Location -> The profile is written exclusively to the **Shard EU**.
- A user registers from São Paulo -> The profile is written to a **South American Shard**.
- **Result:** The company achieves legal compliance at the infrastructure level, avoiding massive fines without needing complex legal workarounds for every data transfer.

### 2. Hyper-Local Real-Time Performance (The "Speed" Use Case)

Crucial for platforms where interaction must feel instantaneous.

- **The Scenario:** A high-frequency trading platform for retail users, or a fast-paced competitive gaming profile system (e.g., matchmaking for eSports).
- **The Problem:** "Speed of light" latency. If a gamer in Tokyo has their profile settings (skins, loadouts, rank) stored in a database in Virginia (USA), every time they open their inventory, there is a 200ms+ delay. This creates a sluggish, unresponsive UX.
- **How the Product Solves It:**
- The Tokyo gamer’s profile is stored on **Shard Asia**.
- The retrieval time drops from ~200ms to <20ms.
- **Result:** The application feels "native" and instant, regardless of where the user is in the world.

### 3. Infinite Scaling for "Super Apps" (The "Capacity" Use Case)

For platforms hitting the upper limits of database technology.

- **The Scenario:** A "Super App" (like WeChat or a global Uber equivalent) that combines messaging, payments, and social feeds, hitting 500M+ to 1B+ users.
- **The Problem:** A single primary database (even a very large one) creates a bottleneck. Writing millions of status updates per second to one centralized location causes write-locks, slow queries, and eventual crashes.
- **How the Product Solves It:**
- The write-load is split. 100 million writes happen in **Shard US-East**, while a completely separate 100 million writes happen in **Shard Asia**.
- **Result:** The platform can scale indefinitely. To double capacity, you don't need a bigger "master" server; you just add a new regional shard.

### 4. Global Fault Isolation (The "Reliability" Use Case)

Protecting the global brand from regional disasters.

- **The Scenario:** A mission-critical communication app (like WhatsApp or Slack for Enterprise).
- **The Problem:** If the main data center in `us-east-1` (Virginia) goes down due to a hurricane or a power grid failure, the _entire world_ loses access. This damages the brand's global reputation.
- **How the Product Solves It:**
- If **Shard US-East** fails, users in New York lose access.
- However, users in London (**Shard EU**) and Tokyo (**Shard Asia**) utilize completely different physical hardware and databases.
- **Result:** A catastrophe becomes a localized incident. The platform maintains 75% global uptime instead of 0%.
